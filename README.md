## Project Description

- This project was designed to put into practice everything I have learnt about React recently.
- It utilises React hooks, state management, props, functions and styling.
- This version runs on the desktop but in the future I would like to implement a mobile-friendly version.

## Game Rules

- There is a random word you are trying to guess
- You have 6 chances to guess 
- If you guess wrong more than 6 times you lose
- You can only guess each letter once

## Screenshots
